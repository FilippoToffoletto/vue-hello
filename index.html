                        <h3>Alright, where did this "woman yelling at a cat" meme start?</h3>
                        <p>The human half of the meme finds its origins from a 2011 episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, where then-cast member Taylor Armstrong found herself in an emotional confrontation with Camille Grammer, as fellow housewife Kyle Richards attempts to calm her down.</p>

                            As for the other half of the meme starring the angry white cat, its origins began on Tumblr, when user deadbefordeath posted a photograph of a white cat with a bewildered expression sitting in a chair in front of a plate of vegetables. The caption back then was: "he no like vegetals.
                            Armstrong told OprahMag.com that she first saw the meme back in August. "It was 'Boomers' 'Millennials' and 'Gen X' featuring Megan Mullally from Will & Grace. Her character, Karen, is fabulous, so it was fun to share a meme moment with her. She and I were featured in a fun Halloween one also. I thought the first scream meme would be the last...I never expected all the future memes to come.
